# Whatâ€™s the difference between error suppression, error mitigation, and error correction?

* the differences between them are not well defined

* error suppression = add control signals (pulse) to prevent the errors we know that might happen

* error mitigation = get the outcomes, analyze them and then try to remove what's incorrect

* error correction = qubit itself with redundancy
