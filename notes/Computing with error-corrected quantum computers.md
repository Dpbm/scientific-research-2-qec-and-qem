# Computing with error-corrected quantum computers

* qLDPC codes - family of codes that requires fewer extra qubits than the conventional codes (can only run clifford gates)

* logical clifford gates doesn't give advantage over classical computing, once they can be simulated efficiently on classical computers

* surface code treat qubits in a geometrical way

* they tilted the qubits into a non-euclidian 3d space (they called manifold). In this way, the holes represent the local qubits, so more holes and larger holes the better the code is

*  color codes could run non-clifford gates using higher dimensions (now qLDPC can as well)
