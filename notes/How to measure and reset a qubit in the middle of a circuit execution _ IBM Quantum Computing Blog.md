## Mid-circuit Measurements

* can be used for boolean tests to check if some qubits is in its properly state

* "stabilizer" measurements check it

* can be use for post-select qubits 

* 



## Reset

* reset a qubit to its initial-state

* internally is a measurement followed by a dynamic application of a X gate
