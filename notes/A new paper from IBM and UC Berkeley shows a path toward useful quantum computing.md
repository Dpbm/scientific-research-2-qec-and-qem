# A new paper from IBM and UC Berkeley shows a path toward useful quantum computing

* tested a 127qubits machine

* it's possible to amplify the noise effects using pulse stretching to get better results

* after extrapolating the noise effects we can use ZNE to post process and show the results how they would look like without noise

* in this case it's error mitigation, not correction

* high-weight observables = more qubits to be measured 

* low-weight observables = less qubits to be measured

* maybe quantum algorithms can be used to verify classical ones

* after this simulation, it's possible to say that quantum computers can be useful for some tasks nowdays (quantum utility era)
