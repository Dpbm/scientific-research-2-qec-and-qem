# Landmark IBM error correction paper published on the cover of Nature

* error correction schemes only works if the error rates are better than some threshold

* some schemes are bad because require too many qubits (overhead)

* quantum low-density parity check codes = error correction code that uses few qubits to check an error

* fault tolerant = errors won't spread and can be corrected faster and they occur

* code distance = how much qubits does it takes to flip completely a 0 to 1

* overhead in this case is the amount fo extra qubits  required
